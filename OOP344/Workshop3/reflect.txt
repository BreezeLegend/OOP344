2. The main Reason for Specializing the initial value for a summation is that it is based on the data type the you use
and you need that to initialize the different values. For example an int would need to be initalized to zero while an array
would need to be initialized with either a zero or string/numbers.

3. The main Reason for defining the class varialble outside the class definition is that we want to use internal linkage 
also known as static, we use this because when we define the class variable outside the class definition we set it so that it is visible 
to all other scopes within its scope. This means that all instances will share the same calss and same variable , so when 
we do set the variables outside its own definition, it will be able to be used anywhere as it will be in global scope.

This workshop was a bit hard for me as I did not fully understand specialization and where to use it, but after doing some 
google searches and asking some friends I finally figured it out.

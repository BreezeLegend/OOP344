While writing the code for this workshop I learned a few things, one thing I learned was how to declare and define move 
and copy operator for a class. Copy constructors initialize a class by creating a copy of that same a class, while copy 
assignment is used to copy one clss to another already written class. But conviniently C++ already provides a copy constructor
and copy assignment operator if there is not one already explicitly written. Where a copy constructor serve to copy classes 
the move constructor and move assignment is to move the ownership of one object to another. But these functions do work in
tandem with each other.

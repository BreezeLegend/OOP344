The differences between implementation of a composition and aggregations is that composition is where two classes have a
relationship that makes them both rely and depedant on each other. Whereas, implementation is when a parent class deconstructs
the child class will also be destroyed because without the parent class the child class would not exist. Finally, aggregation
is where either class can be independant of each other like if one class is destroyed the other would still exist.

The differences between the implementations of move and copy functions in a composition and an aggregation is that for 
aggregation the copy and move function is not responsible for destroying and allocating resources, whereas composition will
the copy and move function will be responsible for destroying and allocating resources.

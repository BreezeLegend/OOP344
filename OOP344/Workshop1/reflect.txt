In this Workshop I was able to review some concepts that I had previously learned in OOP244. 
Such concepts are default constructors, copy constructors, copy assignment, desconstructors, 
also I reviewed working with arrays and pointers, and Classes. I was able to review how to dynamically 
allocate as well as deallocating to prevent memory leaks. Some new information that I learned while writing this 
lab was the use of "static" and "extern" keywords. 

Finally, static is the keyword for Internal Linkage. We use "static" to restrict it to the file containing its 
declaration. An example of this is static int count = 0;, by assigning static to a variable, it allows the variable 
to be only valid within the assigned scope.

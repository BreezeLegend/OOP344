The difference between implementations/utilizations of a functor and lambda expression is that defining a functor adds 
more complexity because you have create a few member variables while a lambda does not even require a class and is therefore
simpler to use, but other than those differences they are essentially the same thing.

One way I would fix the constructor for Spellchecker would be, we can create an array to store all file names and loop them 
to prevent an error.

In my opinion, I do believe that the default constructor is necessary because we would need it for unexpected errors that
might happen to the data.
